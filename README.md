# resume
This is my resume

## notes
 - Default make build command expects a file called `.gpa` with my current gpa. Use `make build-no-gpa` to build just the default resume. Similarly `make clean-no-gpa` to clean (although regular clean should work too).
 - CI/CD enable to autodeploy to [https://sachiniyer.com/resume](https://sachiniyer.com/resume)
